## Introduction

This project implements a library for working with matrices in C++ using OOA.

### An example of a matrix class in C++
```cpp
class Matrix {
    private:
        // Attributes
        int rows_, cols_;         // Rows and columns
        double **matrix_;         // Pointer to the memory where the matrix is allocated

    public:
        Matrix();              // Default constructor
        ~Matrix();             // Destructor

        void SumMatrix(const Matrix& other); 
        // Other methods..
}
```
## Information

### A reminder of the matrix basics

Matrix is a rectangular table of numbers arranged in m rows and n columns

```
    1 2 3
A = 4 5 6
    7 8 9
```

```
     1  2  3  4
Ð’ =  5  6  7  8
     9 10 11 12
```

You can get the desired element using indices as follows A[1,1] = 1, where the first index is the row number, the second is the column number.

The order of a matrix is the number of its rows or columns. \
The main diagonal of a square matrix is the diagonal from the upper left to the lower right corner. \

A rectangular matrix (B) is a matrix with the number of rows not equal to the number of columns. \
A square matrix (A) is a matrix with the number of rows equal to the number of columns.

## Matrix operations

There is a brief description of the matrix operations below that are implemented in the developing library.

| Operation | Description | Exceptional situations |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `bool EqMatrix(const Matrix& other)` | Checks matrices for equality with each other |  |
| `void SumMatrix(const Matrix& other)` | Adds the second matrix to the current one | different matrix dimensions |
| `void SubMatrix(const Matrix& other)` | Subtracts another matrix from the current one | different matrix dimensions |
| `void MulNumber(const double num) ` | Multiplies the current matrix by a number |  |
| `void MulMatrix(const Matrix& other)` | Multiplies the current matrix by the second matrix | the number of columns of the first matrix is not equal to the number of rows of the second matrix |
| `Matrix Transpose()` | Creates a new transposed matrix from the current one and returns it |  |
| `Matrix CalcComplements()` | Calculates the algebraic addition matrix of the current one and returns it | the matrix is not square |
| `double Determinant()` | Calculates and returns the determinant of the current matrix | the matrix is not square |
| `Matrix InverseMatrix()` | Calculates and returns the inverse matrix | matrix determinant is 0 |

Apart from those operations, constructors and destructors are implemented:

| Method | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `Matrix()` | A basic constructor that initialises a matrix of some predefined dimension |  
| `Matrix(int rows, int cols) ` | Parametrized constructor with number of rows and columns |
| `Matrix(const Matrix& other)` | Copy constructor |
| `Matrix(Matrix&& other)` | Move constructor |
| `~Matrix()` | Destructor |

The following operators are overloaded, partially corresponding to the operations above:

| Operator | Description | Exceptional situations |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `+`      | Addition of two matrices | different matrix dimensions |
| `-`   | Subtraction of one matrix from another | different matrix dimensions |
| `*`  | Matrix multiplication and matrix multiplication by a number | the number of columns of the first matrix does not equal the number of rows of the second matrix |
| `==`  | Checks for matrices equality (`EqMatrix`) | |
| `=`  | Assignment of values from one matrix to another one | |
| `+=`  | Addition assignment (`SumMatrix`) | different matrix dimensions |
| `-=`  | Difference assignment (`SubMatrix`) | different matrix dimensions |
| `*=`  | Multiplication assignment (`MulMatrix`/`MulNumber`) | the number of columns of the first matrix does not equal the number of rows of the second matrix |
| `(int i, int j)`  | Indexation by matrix elements (row, column) | index is outside the matrix |


## Implementation

- The program is developed in C++ language of C++17 standard
- The library is implemented as an `Matrix` class
- Use only the `matrix_`, `rows_` and `cols_` fields as private.
- The access to private fields `rows_` and `cols_` is via accessor and mutator. If the matrix increases in size, it is filled with zeros. If it decreases in size, the excess is simply discarded.
- The solution is designed as a static library (with a header file matrix_oop.h)
- Implemented the operations described [above](#matrix-operations)
- Overloaded the operators according to the table in the chapter [above](#matrix-operations)
- Full code coverage with unit tests using the GTest library
-  A Makefile is provided for building the library and tests (with goals all, clean, test, matrix_oop.a)
